There are two ways of downloading and installing this code:
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localCCM26ToFOAM#using-git Using Git]
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localCCM26ToFOAM#using-zip-or-tar Using Zip or Tar]


== Using Git ==
Run the following instructions as normal user:
<ol>
<li>
Assuming you have <tt>git</tt> already installed and a working OpenFOAM installation, run:
<pre>mkdir -p $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone git://github.com/wyldckat/localCCM26ToFOAM.git
cd localCCM26ToFOAM</pre>
</li>

<li>Now check the list of branches that exist:
<pre>git branch -a</pre>
You should see something like this:
<pre>* master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/of20
  remotes/origin/of21
  remotes/origin/of22
  remotes/origin/of23
  remotes/origin/of30
</pre>
The ones that start with <tt>of</tt> indicate for which versions of OpenFOAM this repository is currently working.
</li>

<li>So for example, if you are using OpenFOAM 2.1.1, then ''checkout'' the respective branch:
<pre>git checkout of21</pre>
On the other hand, if are using OpenFOAM 2.4, then you can simply use the <tt>of23</tt> branch.
</li>

<li>Now you can launch the build process:
<pre>./ccm26local</pre>
It will do everything pretty much autonomous, although midway it asks for you to read the details and then press the ''Enter'' keyboard key. It will then download the <tt>libccmio</tt> library source code from VisIt repository.
</li>

<li>It should end with the last lines similar to these:
<pre>make: '/home/ofuser/OpenFOAM/ofuser-2.0.x/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/bin/ccm26ToFoam' is up to date.

The output above has been logged inside the file 'build.log'.
</pre>
</li>

<li>If all went well, you can now learn how ot use this conversor by running the following command:
<pre>ccm26ToFoam -help</pre>
